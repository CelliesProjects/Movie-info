# Movie-info

A PHP/jQuery webpage to display movie info for a local folder with movies in separate subfolders.

The movie info is downloaded from themoviedb.org.

An account at themoviedb.org is necessary to use the API functions and obtain an api key.

The key needed to access themoviedb.org api is read from '../TMDBapikey.txt' which because it is my personal key is not included. You will have to provide your own.

Developed for Linux. Needs some work to run on Windows.
